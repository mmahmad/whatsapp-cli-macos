# Claude Context - WhatsApp Companion Data Analyzer

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive WhatsApp message search and conversation browsing tool for macOS that evolved from a simple fuzzy search utility into a full-featured data analysis companion. The tool provides local, privacy-first searching through WhatsApp's SQLite databases with advanced fuzzy matching, interactive navigation, and natural conversation flow.

## Development History & Evolution

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation
- Started as a basic fuzzy search tool for WhatsApp messages
- Used fuzzywuzzy library for text matching
- Simple command-line interface with basic pagination
- Performance issues with large datasets (GBs of data, slow loading times)

### Phase 2: Chat Viewing Feature
- **User Request**: "This tool so far is a querying tool. I'd love to expand to just viewing a chat, given the contact name. We'd paginate through the conversation"
- Added complete conversation browsing functionality
- Implemented contact fuzzy matching with multiple strategies
- Added pagination for long conversation histories
- Created separate display formatting for chat vs search modes

### Phase 3: Contact Matching Improvements
- **Issue Identified**: Search for "Basit Bhai" incorrectly returned "Yasir Bhai" instead of "Basit Hussain"
- **Solution**: Implemented multi-strategy contact matching with priority scoring:
  - `starts_with_match`: 105% priority (highest)
  - `exact_match`: 100% priority (high)
  - `word_match_score >= 0.5`: 90-95% range
  - Fallback to standard fuzzy scores
- Added contact match transparency showing all candidates with scores

### Phase 4: CLI Restructuring
- **User Request**: "I want to make changes to how the params are passed to the program. query should be an option to pass, while view-chat should be the positional arg. And let's change view-chat to just 'chat'"
- Completely restructured argument parsing:
  - `chat` became positional argument (main contact name)
  - `--query` became optional for both global and contact-specific search
  - Maintained backward compatibility via `--contact` option
- Updated all logic to handle new argument structure

### Phase 5: Conversation Flow Optimization
- **User Issue**: "the visualization is showing oldest messages at the bottom while newest at the top. This means that longer conversations require the person to scroll up. Can we reverse this so that conversations are in chronologically ascending order?"
- **User Clarification**: "Basically, in pagination, we want to show the most recent page first. Older pages are next pages. But in any page, the older messages first (top), followed by newer at the bottom"
- **Implementation**: Hybrid approach using DESC query for pagination + in-memory reversal for chronological reading within pages
- **Result**: Natural messaging app flow - recent conversations on page 1, chronological order within each page

## Core Technical Architecture

### WhatsAppSearcher Class (Main Engine)
- **Database Management**: Handles multiple WhatsApp database paths and read-only connections
- **Search Methods**:
  - `search_messages()`: Global fuzzy search across all conversations
  - `view_chat()`: Browse entire conversations with specific contacts
  - `search_by_contact()`: Search within specific contact's messages
- **Performance Optimizations**: Contact name caching, result caching, database-level filtering
- **Interactive Navigation**: Session-based state management for GUI-like experience

### Multi-Strategy Fuzzy Matching
```python
# Priority-based contact matching
if starts_with_match:
    combined_score = 105  # Highest priority
elif exact_match:
    combined_score = 100  # High priority  
elif word_match_score >= 0.5:
    combined_score = 90 + (word_match_score * 5)  # 90-95 range
```

### Database Schema Understanding
- **ZWAMESSAGE**: Core message table with text, timestamps, sender info
- **ZWACHATSESSION**: Chat sessions (individual/group) with partner names
- **ZWAGROUPMEMBER**: Group member mappings for group messages
- **ContactsV2.sqlite**: Secondary database for enhanced contact name resolution
- **Timestamp Conversion**: Core Data format (seconds since Jan 1, 2001) to Unix timestamps

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Database-Level Filtering**: SQL LIKE patterns reduce candidate set by 80-90%
2. **Contact Name Pre-loading**: Eliminates N+1 query problem
3. **Result Caching**: Complete result sets cached by search parameters
4. **Early Termination**: Stop processing after 10,000 results
5. **Typo-Tolerant Patterns**: Generate multiple SQL patterns for common typos

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Global Message Search
- Fuzzy search across all WhatsApp conversations
- Multiple sorting options (relevance, time)
- Configurable fuzzy matching thresholds
- Smart pagination with result caching

### 2. Chat Viewing
- Browse entire conversations with any contact
- Natural messaging app flow (recent first, chronological within pages)
- Fuzzy contact matching with transparency
- Interactive navigation with single-key commands

### 3. Contact-Specific Search
- Search within individual conversations
- Dual scoring system (contact match + message match)
- Combined with chat viewing for comprehensive contact interaction

### 4. Interactive Navigation
- Default GUI-like experience within CLI
- Single-key commands: n/p (navigation), g (jump), l (limit), t/r (sorting), c (cache), q (quit)
- Session persistence - no need to re-run commands
- Smart caching for consistent page navigation

### 5. Advanced Display Formatting
- Rich visual formatting with emojis and separators
- Different display modes for search vs chat viewing
- Message truncation for long content with character counts
- Clear sender identification (You vs Contact Name)

## Command Line Interface

### New Structure (Post-Phase 4)
```bash
# Chat viewing (positional argument)
python3 whatsapp_search.py "John Doe"

# Global search (query option)
python3 whatsapp_search.py --query "pizza"

# Contact-specific search (both arguments)
python3 whatsapp_search.py "Mom" --query "appointment"

# Database statistics
python3 whatsapp_search.py --stats
```

### Interactive Mode (Default)
- Seamless navigation without re-running commands
- Instant page switching with cached results
- Dynamic sorting changes
- Page size adjustment on-the-fly
- Cache management controls
