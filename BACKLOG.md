# Product Backlog
## WhatsApp Companion Data Analyzer

### Technical Improvements

#### High Priority
Currently no high priority items.

#### Medium Priority
- **Contact search caching for consistency**
  - **Description**: Add result caching to contact search (`"John" --query "term"`) to match global search behavior
  - **Benefit**: Consistent navigation experience - going back to previous pages shows identical results
  - **Effort**: Low - can reuse existing caching infrastructure from global search
  - **Status**: Nice-to-have for consistency

#### Low Priority
- **Configuration system**
  - **Description**: Add persistent user preferences (default page size, threshold, sort order)
  - **Benefit**: Users don't need to specify common preferences repeatedly
  - **Effort**: Medium - requires settings file management

- **Memory optimization for very large datasets**
  - **Description**: Stream results instead of loading all into memory for 500k+ message datasets
  - **Benefit**: Lower memory usage for power users with massive message histories
  - **Effort**: Medium - requires refactoring result handling

### Feature Enhancements

#### Phase 2 Features (From PRD)
- **Export functionality**: Export search results to various formats (CSV, JSON, TXT)
- **Advanced filtering**: Date ranges, message types, sender filtering
- **Batch operations**: Process multiple search queries simultaneously
- **Configuration file**: Persistent user preferences and settings

#### Phase 3 Features (From PRD)
- **GUI interface**: Optional graphical interface for non-technical users
- **Cross-platform support**: Windows and Linux compatibility
- **Integration APIs**: Allow other applications to use search functionality
- **Cloud sync**: Secure cloud-based search index synchronization

### Technical Debt

#### Resolved ✅
- ✅ ~~Hard-coded database paths~~ → Now dynamically discovered
- ✅ ~~README cleanup~~ → Reorganized with specialized documentation
- ✅ ~~CLI argument restructuring~~ → Intuitive positional + optional structure
- ✅ ~~Contact matching accuracy~~ → Multi-strategy priority matching implemented

#### Remaining
- **Limited cross-platform support**: Currently macOS-only
  - **Effort**: High - requires Windows/Linux database path discovery and testing
  - **Priority**: Low - current user base is primarily macOS

- **Error recovery improvements**: Some database connection errors could be handled better
  - **Effort**: Low - add more specific error handling
  - **Priority**: Low - current error handling is adequate

### User Experience Improvements

#### Nice-to-Have
- **Search suggestions**: Show suggested search terms based on message content
- **Search history**: Remember recent searches within session
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Additional single-key navigation options
- **Color themes**: Support for different terminal color schemes
- **Progress bars**: Visual progress indicators for very long searches

### Performance Enhancements

#### Future Optimizations
- **Incremental indexing**: Pre-build search indexes for very large datasets
- **Async processing**: Non-blocking search for better user experience
- **Parallel processing**: Multi-threaded search for CPU-intensive operations
- **Database optimization**: Custom SQL indexes for frequently accessed queries

### Integration Ideas

#### Potential Integrations
- **Alfred workflow**: macOS Alfred integration for quick searches
- **Terminal multiplexer integration**: tmux/screen session management
- **Shell completion**: Bash/zsh autocompletion for commands
- **System notifications**: Desktop notifications for long-running searches

## Backlog Management

### Adding Items
When adding new backlog items:
1. Categorize appropriately (Technical/Feature/UX/Performance)
2. Set priority level (High/Medium/Low)
3. Estimate effort (Low/Medium/High)
4. Include clear description and benefit

### Prioritization Criteria
- **High Priority**: Critical issues affecting core functionality
- **Medium Priority**: Improvements that enhance user experience significantly
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have features that don't impact core workflows

### Status Tracking
- **Proposed**: Initial idea, needs discussion
- **Accepted**: Approved for future development
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Move to resolved section with ✅

## Notes

This backlog represents potential future improvements identified during development. Items are not committed features and should be prioritized based on user feedback and development capacity.

Current focus remains on maintaining and supporting the existing feature set, which already provides comprehensive WhatsApp search and browsing capabilities.
